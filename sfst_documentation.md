In our programme we used rules to treat diphthongs in the root of some Spanish irregular verbs. For instance, the verb
"volver" presents a diphthong in the paradigm "vuelva"; consequently, we say that the root of "volver" has two allomorphs,
one with the vowel /o/ and another with the diphthong /ue/. This phenomenon is also conditioned by a phonological rule:
in the verbal roots with this apophony, the diphthong /ue/ appears exclusively when the syllable is tonic.

We implemented three different flexion classes corresponding to the three different conjugations one can find in Spanish.
The first conjugation is represented by those verbs ending in -ar such as "volar" or "comprar", the second by those ending
in -ir such as "perder" or "entender", and the third by those ending in -ir such as "dormir" or "morir". Within these
flexion classes we made the distinction between indicative and subjective verb forms in the present. As advised in the
exercise sheet, we organised our entries in the lexicon files distinguishing the stems from the lemmas. As an example,
the verb "trabajar" is written as "trabaja:<>r:<>" in our lexicon file.

To check whether the verbs are conjugated correctly, we strongly recommend using the following online conjugator:
